### Abstract:
Now-a-days the difficult to tracking the mobile devices has become an issue. Various needs are arising for finding out ways of tracking mobile devices. In this research paper included different algorithm for location tracking. The activity of tracking includes learning and inference, sensing. WI-FI signals are much useful in places where the wired connections are not possible to set up. This paper attempts to categorize these mobile guides using a detailed set of evaluation criteria in order to extract design principles which can be used by application designers and developers. Location sensing provides endless opportunities for a wide range of applications in GPS-obstructed environments, where, typically, there is a need for a higher degree of accuracy. In this paper, we focus on robust range estimation, an important prerequisite for fine-grained localization.
